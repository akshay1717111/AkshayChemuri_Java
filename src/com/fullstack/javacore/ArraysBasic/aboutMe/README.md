project methodology was agile
I have experience in health care, banking, retail industry projects.
My current project is developing dashboard for nike product and my role is full stack developer, and initial estimation of my project is for 2 years.

2) current project
   Currently, my project is building a dynamic dashboard for Nike product that shows customer analysis and behavior. The main aspect of the project is to represent data from SQL into dynamic visualization. Front end we are using an angular framework and javascript libraries and coming to the backend Java, and Sprint boot. I'm also working on an SQL database where for this project we don't hit the production database to fetch the data however we will store the data by using the Java scheduler tool and dump the data in the Oracle database. Hence, using data in visualizing format in the front end side.
   we are following the agile methodology and I receive mostly development and handling database user stories. Based on the task which I receive after a successful competition I prepare a design document and do unit testing on my local machine after a successful competition, the testing team would provide inputs based on that if I need to change I will develop with additional functionality or else deploy in the test environment. And then forward it to the UAT team before deploying it in production.
